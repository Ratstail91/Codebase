-------------------------
Consider possible additions
-------------------------

*	Remove "Callback" phrase from simple and complex callback functions; leave them as short phrases.
*	Remove ConfigUtility's inheritance from a std container.
*	"Target" option in CameraUtility, targeting an origin?
*	New modules such as TCP networking, animation, rotation(done), or sound management
*	Sound manager(SDL_mixer)
*	GitHub wiki needs to be fleshed out

-	Upgrading and compatabilities with SDL 1.3
-	Rename SceneMgr to GameMgr?
-	Move the Scene macros to quick start from BaseScene
-	add entry and exit functions to the frameworks, not-unlike constructors/destructors?
-	the callback systems don't cleanup after themselfs well.
-	Generic "single base class" (Does Simple Callbacks count as this? No, I need an actual class)
-	Particle system? (boost the popularity!)
-	Make SceneMgr static?
-	change ConfigUtility::Real() to a float return (impossible due to atof() return type)
