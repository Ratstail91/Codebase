Consider possible additions

-------------------------

*	Remove ConfigUtility's inheritance from a std container.
*	"Target" option in CameraUtility, targeting an origin?
*	New modules such as TCP networking, animation, rotation(done), or sound management
*	Sound manager(SDL_mixer)
*	GitHub wiki needs to be fleshed out
*	Fix the inconsistency between sc and cc quit functions
*	fix any inconsistencies between sc and cc
*	Image::LoadImage(SDL_Surface*); //derp wat?
*	CameraUtility could be abstract
*	Remove the "Utility" state of the classes
*	I need logical names for all classes AND functions

-	Upgrading and compatabilities with SDL 1.3
-	add entry and exit functions to complex callbacks, not-unlike constructors/destructors?
--	the callback systems don't cleanup after themselves well.
-	Particle system? (boost the popularity!)
-	Make SceneMgr static/singleton?
-	Wrap SDL stuff in Codebase-specific data types, abstracting away SDL?
