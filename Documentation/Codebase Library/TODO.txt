Ordered list:

...

-------------------------

Unordered list:

*	Flesh out the wiki, and keep it up to date.
*	Specify the exit codes in Complex Callbacks, and update the wiki accordingly.
*	"Target" option in CameraUtility, targeting an origin?
*	Animation
*	TCPNetwork
*	ImageRot
*	EntityRot
*	Sound manager(SDL_mixer)

-	Image::LoadImage(SDL_Surface*); //derp wat?
-	I need logical names for all classes AND functions
-	Move this TODO list into the GitHub issue tracker?
-	Upgrading and compatabilities with SDL 1.3
-	add entry and exit functions to complex callbacks, not-unlike constructors/destructors?
--	the callback systems don't cleanup after themselves well.
-	Particle system? (boost the popularity!)
-	Make SceneMgr static/singleton?
-	Wrap SDL stuff in Codebase-specific data types, abstracting away SDL?
-	Reduce/remove Entity's inheritance?
-	Reduce the overreliance on inheritance: "is-a" vs "has-a"
