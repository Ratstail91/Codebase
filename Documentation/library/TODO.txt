Migrate old modules

Linked List-?

callback frameworks -?

Notes:
Move the #include "this_file's_header.h" to the top of the include lists.

BBox functions are compatable with SDL_Rect if implemented as a template; ommitted for now.
The user can cast SDL_Rect as a BBox without any problems.

-------------------------

Main Modules (the most generic available):
>	Vector2
>	Vector3
>	Image	//the only one that depends on SDL!!
>	Animator
>	BBox
>	FrameRate
>	Delta
>	ConfigUtility
end

Aux Modules (not generic):	
	//can be modded as needed, requires SDL_net or other library, could be a main module
*	NetworkUDP
*	NetworkTCP
	
	//only for C, but kind of pointless with scene system + C++ in all of the other code
*	Simple Callbacks
*	Complex Callbacks
end

Game Modules (should be implemented in the game rather than cb):
>	Scene
>	SceneManager
*	Camera
*	Actor
	
*	xxxManager //from a multition? MultitionManager? Abstract factory possibly
*	ImageManager
end
