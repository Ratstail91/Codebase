doesn't need to update all of the time, so only call update when there's an animation
This looks like it can be just a number cruncher.

assuming a horizontal sprite strip:
	sclip.x = frame * sclip.w

Animator:
	Constructor
	Destructor
	
	Update()
	
-	DrawTo(dest, x, y) //wraps around image, but only if image is used
	
	SetFrame()
	SetFrameCount()
	GetFrame()
	GetFrameCount()
	
	SetInterval() //also resets tick
	GetInterval()
	GetTick()
	
private:
-	Image image //loading, rendering (could remove this, to unhook it from cb)
	
	int frame //current frame index
	int framecount //number of frames
	
	time_t tick //tick of the last frame
	time_t interval //time between frame changes
end
