## Codebase

This repository holds a collection of my generic reusable code modules. This is a "reboot" of the previous version, since I'm trying to remove problems that come with legacy code written over two years ago.

## Instructions

After building the project in Release configuration, dir-build.bat is called by VC++ to create a usable directory tree. if you use a different compiler, just run the script. If you use a platform that can't run batch... sorry.

If you want to play around with the Hello World example, you'll need the resources found [here](https://github.com/downloads/Ratstail91/Codebase/data.rar).
