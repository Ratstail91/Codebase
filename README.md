## Codebase

This repository holds a collection of my generic reusable code modules.

## Instructions

This project requires C++11 and SDL 1.2.

Simply choose which files you want to include, and copy/paste them into your project. Some classes require other classes in this project, so make sure that you have all of the dependencies.

Code reuse favours aggregation rather than inheritance.
