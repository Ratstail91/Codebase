## Instructions

This project was written on Windows 7 using Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition, therefore the cross-platform compatibility is currently unknown. Any information concerning this is appreciated.

When you open the VC++ solution, you must switch the configuration to "Release" before building otherwise you will get errors.

The file "dir-build.bat" is a batch script that is designed to create a usable library directory (the so called "product" of the project). It is automatically called during the build process in VC++. The output directory, titled "Codebase Library" can be copied to the C:\ drive and added to VC++'s known directories.
